Data Transformations

Clarity Rank: The original clarity values (e.g., IF, VVS2, SI1) were converted into a numeric scale to allow for proper sorting and comparison.

Cut Rank: Non-numeric cut values (e.g., Fair, Good, Premium) were assigned numeric ranks to enable ordered analysis.

Color Rank: Color grades (e.g., D through J) were mapped to corresponding numeric values to facilitate evaluation.
